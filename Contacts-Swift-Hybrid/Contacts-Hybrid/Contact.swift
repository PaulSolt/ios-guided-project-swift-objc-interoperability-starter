// QUESTION: Why did I use a class?

// struct from Swift doesn't work in Objective-C
// Must use a class in Swift if we want to use it from Objective-C
// ModelController is going to be in Objective-C

@objc class Contact: NSObject {
	@objc var name: String
	@objc var relationship: String?
	
	@objc init(name: String, relationship: String?) {
		self.name = name
		self.relationship = relationship
	}
}
